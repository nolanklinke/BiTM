Alex's notes on potential future functionality for BiTM
Last updated 7/12

-------------------**POTENTIALUPDATES**--------------------
**Firebase**
- Setup preferences to save (location + preferred currencies)

**Navbar**
- Could add nav options for Charts + Maps + News back in and make them "jump down" to the right element. 
- What future elements might we want to add?
    - Investment platforms and ways to trade crypto (possible partnership opportunities there)
    - Most-shared content about Crypto from market experts or mass social media activity

**Buttons + Charts**
- Make a stronger border or color change on Crypto button click.
- Maybe adjust this section so the buttons act as tabs that populate when a user clicks into them, rather than populating a different window into existence when they click "GO".
    - These could order dynamically based on user preferences -- put the ones that matter first and have a "favorite" display as the default.

**Map**
- Fix search bar functionality ... something is wrong with API key / access when deployed
- Fix search bar positioning on mobile. Some of the default map controls overlap with it

**News**
- Fix to make articles update more frequently
- Possibly look into other news APIs that would let us sort articles by specific currency mentioned (could tie to user preferences)
- Could also consider having a "top news" panel with a few new items + a "your news" panel with articles for specific currencyes (user prefs)

**Other**
- Add a footer
- Logo / slogan
